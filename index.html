				<p>Hello, my name is Nilay Alwar, and this is my personal website! I am a junior
				at Texas A&M University studying computer science. The areas I am most interested
				in are AI/machine learning and cybersecurity (I am currently taking CSCE 421
				and CSCE 477, which you can find more information about
				<a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/csce/">here</a>).
				Obviously, a lot of my time is currently devoted to my education, but outside 
				of that, I am a big fan of the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/">NFL</a>
				and <a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA</a> (My favorite NFL team, the 
				<a href="https://www.seahawks.com/">Seattle Seahawks</a>, just won the Super Bowl), 
				and have regularly played chess online for the past few years. You can find my 
				chess.com profile <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/undefined1234">here</a>. 
				On this website, you can find my portfolio, qualifications, service work, and 
				a page that is generated by AI. You can find my Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilay-alwar/">here</a>. 
				Thank you for viewing my website!</p>

				<p>When I am part of a team, I like to take on a dynamic role. My personal 
				philosophy is that I should not always take a lead role or a supporting role,
				but that I should choose my role based on the task at hand. I will make sure to 
				communicate with team members to ensure that the project is completed and that 
				it is of high quality, and I will make sure to complete any work delegated to me 
				in a timely manner. I would describe myself as more analytical, as I think problem 
				solving is my biggest strength, as I have a lot of experience with that. I will
				make sure to keep a positive attitude and to stay motivated throughout the project.
