				<p> I have volunteered quite a bit through my life. Most of that volunteering
                came in middle and high school. Throughout those years, I would estimate that 
                I volunteered for around 60 hours in total. The volunteering I did primarily 
                consisted of helping out at various local events, as well as helping out my 
                schools at the time.

                <p> I also worked as a math tutor for two summers, where I 
                helped students from elementary school to early high school with their math 
                skills. While I was paid for this, I still helped other people in the community,
                so I thought I would at least mention this, even though I don't count it as 
                true service, since I was paid for it. I would also add that I made sure to 
                teach the students as well as I could, as I believe that is something that 
                is part of the ethics of being a teacher.</p>
