				<p> As stated on my resume, I have quite a few technical skills. I 
                have experience with several programming languages, including Java, Python,
                C/C++, SQL, and Haskell. Of those languages, I would say that I am most
                proficient in Java and C++, as I coded almost exclusively in Java throughout
                high school, and I have used C++ quite a bit in my computer science courses
                at Texas A&M. I also have an IT certification in Java that I earned in my 
                senior year of high school. I also have knowledge about a variety of important
                topics, including data structures and algorithms, relational databases, and
                I will be learning machine learning this semester.

				<p> The area of computer science that interests me the most is AI/machine 
                learning. It blows my mind how the AI models are able to be so effective, as
                it is an extremely complicated task to program something like that. In addition,
                I play chess regularly, and the chess engines, which use neural networks,
                are ridiculously strong. They are so strong that even 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a>, the 
                best chess player in the world by far, would get crushed by them. More information
                about chess engines can be found <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)>
                here</a>. Learning about how those engines are able to become so strong would 
                be a great experience for me. My dream project would probably be to create my 
                own chess engine that is at least far stronger than me.
