				<p>In terms of projects, I haven't done too many advanced projects yet, but
				I would like to change that. This semester, I plan to do a project with the 
				<a href="https://www.aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a>, which should 
				give me a lot more experience. In terms of what I have done, I have created 
				some websites, including this one. I have also created some basic 
				applications and have done some work with databases as well.

				<p> I have also started working on a certification with NVIDIA. This 
				certification is on Gen AI LLMs. I plan to have this finished by March or 
				April. Per NVIDIA's website, "The NCA Generative AI LLMs certification is an 
				entry-level credential that validates the foundational concepts for developing,
				 integrating, and maintaining AI-driven applications using generative AI and 
				large language models (LLMs) with NVIDIA solutions." You can find more
				information about this certification 
				<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/learn/certification/generative-ai-llm-associate/">here</a>.
				I am preparing for this certification using a course on Coursera, which you can find

				here</a>.</p>
