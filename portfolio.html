				<p>In terms of projects, I haven't done too many advanced projects yet, but
				I would like to change that. This semester, I plan to do a project with the 
				Aggie Coding Club, which should give me a lot more experience.
				In terms of what I have done, I have created some websites, including 
				this one. I have also created some basic applications and have done some
				work with databases as well.

				<p> I have also started working on a certification with NVIDIA. This 
				certification is on Gen AI LLMs. I plan to have this finished by March or 
				April. Per NVIDIA's website, "The NCA Generative AI LLMs certification is an 
				entry-level credential that validates the foundational concepts for developing,
				 integrating, and maintaining AI-driven applications using generative AI and 
				large language models (LLMs) with NVIDIA solutions."
